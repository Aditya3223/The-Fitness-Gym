		<h1>Yoga for Everyone</h1>
		<div id="yoga0">
			
		</div>
		<div class="yogaDescription">
			<p>
				It’s time to roll out your yoga mat and discover the combination of physical and mental exercises that for thousands of years have hooked yoga practitioners around the globe. The beauty of yoga is that you don’t have to be a yogi or yogini to reap the benefits. Whether you are young or old, overweight or fit, yoga has the power to calm the mind and strengthen the body. Don’t be intimidated by yoga terminology, fancy yoga studios and complicated poses. Yoga is for everyone.
			</p>
			<p>
				The building blocks of yoga are poses. These are good ones to learn as you build a regular yoga practice.
				These 10 poses are a complete yoga workout. Move slowly through each pose, remembering to breathe as you move. Pause after any pose you find challenging, especially if you are short of breath, and start again when your breathing returns to normal. The idea is to hold each pose for a few, slow breaths before moving on to the next one.
			</p>
		</div>
			<h3>Child's Pose</h3>
			<p>
				This calming pose is a good default pause position. You can use child’s pose to rest and refocus before continuing to your next pose. It gently stretches your lower back, hips, thighs, knees and ankles and relaxes your spine, shoulders and neck.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Do it: </b>	When you want to get a nice gentle stretch through your neck spine and hips.
			</p>		
			<p>
				<b> Skip it: </b>If you have knee injuries or ankle problems. Avoid also if you have high blood pressure or are pregnant.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Modify: </b>	You can rest your head on a cushion or block. You can place a rolled towel under your ankles if they are uncomfortable.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Be mindful: </b>	Focus on relaxing the muscles of the spine and lower back as you breathe.
			</p>
